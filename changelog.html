<h2>Change Log</h2>

<h3>v0.0.1</h3>
<p>
  The initial release.

    Tedious is just about useable for simple statements.
  </li>

    Session establishment and authentication work.

<ul>
  <li>
    Changed the API quite a bit, and documented it.

    Use a statemachine for connection state

    Make packet size configurable.
  </li>
</ul>
