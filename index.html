<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
  Tedious is a
  <a href="http://nodejs.org">Node</a>
  package that provides an implementation of the
  <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd304523.aspx">TDS protocol</a>,
  which is used to interact with instances of Microsoft's SQL Server.
</p>

<h3>
  Platform support
</h3>
<p>
  Tedious (and its dependencies) is pure Javascript
  (well, the source is <a href="http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/">CoffeeScript</a>),
  and it should run without change on any platform where Node is supported.
</p>

<h3>
  TDS version
</h3>
<p>
  The TDS version supported is 7.2.
  This means that Tedious should work with SQL Server 2005 and later.
  The integration tests pass with SQL Server 2005 and SQL Server 2008.
</p>

<p>
  Later versions of TDS may be supported in the future, but it is unlikely that earlier
  versions will be supported.
</p>

<h3>
  Name
</h3>
<p>
  The name
  <span class="code">Tedious</span>
  is simply derived from a fast,
  slightly garbled, pronunciation of the letters
  T,&nbsp;D&nbsp;and&nbsp;S.
